# What I've Learned About AI from Fastai

As I've never completed any university courses with a focus on AI and have also never explored the topic in my personal time, I have learnt a lot about AI from the fast.ai courses. 

For instance, the fast.ai course: *Is it a bird? Creating a model from your own data* showed me the step by step instructions on how to set up, train, and use an AI model to recognise pictures of birds. The link to said course can be found here: [is it a bird?](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data)

Something else I found really useful in fast.ai was the link to the AI dictionary, which explains numerous AI terminologies with simple and concise explanations. The link to the dictionary can be found here: [dictionary](https://forbo7.github.io/dictionary/)

Overall, I think one of the major things I've learned about AI using the fast.ai course is that AI is not as complicated and mind-boggling as I initially thought, and this is all thanks to the in-depth explanations and exercises available on fast.ai.
